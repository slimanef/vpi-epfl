      <legend>How to use the application ?</legend>
      <p>Configure your web browser to :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>accept cookies</li>
        <li>enable Javascript</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After a delay without any action (30' by default configuration) you will be disconnected from the server. In case you had left some windows opened and try to send some commands to the server through these windows you will get an error message telling you are not authorized to do so.</p>
      <p>The solution is to reload the page to get the identification prompt and to identify again. If this happens inside an editor window that you didn't save, do not reload that window but instead start a new session from a new window, then you will be able to save your content from the first legacy window. Anyway it is always best to save your content before leaving the computer or before switching to another activity.</p>
      <p class="text-warning" style="font-size: 120%">This application is designed to run on <b>Firefox</b>, USE this browser before raising any issue. It has been reported to work on Chrome and Safari too, but this is untested.</p>
